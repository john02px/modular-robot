# A Self-Assembling Modular Robot System

![Alt text](https://github.com/john02px/modular-robot/blob/main/modular-robot/Project%20Photos/Multi%20Module.JPG?raw=true)

 This project showcases the design and manufacturing of a self-assembling modular robotic system, with each robot possessing 4 degrees of freedom, wheel-based locomotion, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, and an electromagnet-based connection system.

Controlled through a combination of AprilTags, computer vision using OpenCV, and PID controllers for precise position and movement instructions, the system's functionality has been validated through extensive tests. These tests include assessing the robot's speed in various assembly configurations, speed under cargo load, and the strength of inter-robot connections. Simulated challenging environments were created to validate the overall self-assembly performance of the robotic system.
